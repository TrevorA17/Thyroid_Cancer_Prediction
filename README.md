# Thyroid Cancer Prediction
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of thyroid cancer stages using a clinical dataset containing patient demographics, medical history, examination findings, and tumor characteristics. By applying supervised machine learning models—including Random Forest, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and XGBoost—we aim to classify patients into their respective cancer stages. The best-performing model (XGBoost) was selected based on accuracy and kappa scores obtained through cross-validation and resampling techniques. The final model has been deployed as a RESTful API using Plumber, enabling real-time prediction of thyroid cancer stage from new patient inputs. This tool can assist clinicians in preliminary risk stratification and enhance decision-making in cancer management.
